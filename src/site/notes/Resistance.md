# Resistance

#type/insight 

Resistance of course is the opposite of surrender. Resistance against what? It is resistance against God or the cosmic power. Unconditional Love Dilullo calls it. Resistance against energy flowing through you. The moment we conceptualize we resist. An object requires a separate subject and it requires freezing. Mental activity throws up an insulating screen. All that is contrary to flow. Feeling without conceptualizing is surrender. All roads lead to surrender.
Could it be that enlightenment is just the removal of all tension in us? So as to be the perfect conduit for universal love? Tension is trying to freeze, hold on to, conceptualize, desire, fear; all activities of Ego. It must be so.
So could the key be 'just feel'? Is this tantamount to surrender? It seems more direct even than self enquiry.
