# Involved vs Detached

I note that people can basically be put on a scale from 100% detached to 100% involved. Involvement means suffering, selfishness, seriousness, heaviness, stagnation, stress and cramps, problems, sense of doership, ignorance, strong beliefs, concrete world. Detachment means happiness, altruism, humor, lightness, streaming, relaxation, clarity, surrender, enlightenment, beliefs are questioned and dropped (and thereby energy released) world becomes abstract.

Only in detached state there can be happiness and therefore love.

But what exactly is involved? The Ego is involved. The Ego is the ghost entity that claims ownership and authorship (doer-ship), that seeks gratification (perhaps also fears and desires – or should we also split into functional fears and desires? I don't think so. Interest keeps us involved. Which is also identification. So desire and fears yes they should go.), that worries, that blames, that feels guilty that is proud and arrogant, that fantasizes, imagines. In other words all mental activity not in the here and now not addressing what is naturally required for functioning. The extra layer in other words that obscures and creates suffering and ultimately maintains duality. We have to cut through this layer. Or rather that layer must go.  So Ego must go in this definition and any philosophy that states Ego is not a problem but it is your attitude towards the Ego does not make sense because what maintains the attitude? It is also Ego. The attitude is that matters and it is not an attitude that can be adopted but an attitude that grows on you is more or less involved.

What is detachment (dispassion)? It is giving up interest. Whatever arises does so. No importance is attached to it. No interest is given. This means that no psychic energy (emotion but I think it is Qi) is imbued into it. When that happens there is a opening or merging with cosmic energy. The shell is broken. Detachment is bliss. 

I feel detachment leads to sensitivity to the more abstract and with the recognition of the abstract comes the means of manipulating it. Manipulating the abstract (fine) is much more powerful than manipulating the concrete (coarse).
