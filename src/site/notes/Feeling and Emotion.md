# Feeling and Emotion

I consider feeling as the perception of energy. But what about emotion? It is not more like a chemical produced by the organs? This matches Chinese medicine. It also feels like that in a way. It is almost like tasting depression, shame etc. There are four main chemicals that play a big role, including **serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline and oxytocin**. Emotions then are bodily processes that are started on by a complex of perception, feelings and thought.
