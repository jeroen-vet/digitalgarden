#type/insight 

There is a base panic [恐慌](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=panic# "Show information about all characters") (kong3huang1) in all people that is akin to animals always looking for food but worse as thinking is involved. So there is a continuous narrative that reinforces this panic or anxiety [焦急](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=anxiety# "Show information about all characters")(jiao1ji2). Survival. Food, shelter, social acceptance, order but perhaps above all  maintaining the image one has of oneself and defending the ingrained beliefs in general. The panic arises from the idea that we are the body, that we grow older and die to lose all. It is manifested by impatience, restlessness, a feeling of urgency a continuous rush, insensitivity, alienation. 
Once one identifies the panic as just a feeling (stemming from the belief in separation, scarcity and finitude) and refuses to spin stories around that feeling the panic is stopped or rather not paid attention to so it will peter out. At that moment we sink into the dantian. Breathing changes to become longer and in the belly, the body relaxes and well being 怡然自得 arises. The mind is cool and alert and sensitive.  Intellect can function smoothly, intuition is clear. We move like we were supposed to move as animals, gracefully.
It all starts with the recognition that we are consciousness and eternal. We are just John Smith playing the role of King Lear. Recognizing our true nature we can relax and regard this world as a playground. We can play or not play, win or lose it really doesn't matter at all. We can now heed our calling as it will come through loud and clear. To the extent that we are still fettered we regard the world as a practice ground. 
It is amazingly simple, but it requires an intuition, a sensitivity to recognize this panic and the presence to disengage from it. Reaching that point is awakening, being stable in it is enlightenment.
